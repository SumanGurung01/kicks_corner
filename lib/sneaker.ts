Released again in October 2018, this retro helped fulfill Kanye West’s oft-repeated ‘YEEZYs for everyone’ Twitter mantra, as adidas organized the biggest drop in Yeezy history by promising pre-sale to anyone who signed up on the website. Similar to the first release, the ‘Triple White’ 2018 model features a Primeknit upper, a Boost midsole and custom adidas and Yeezy co-branding on the insole.</p>\n",
